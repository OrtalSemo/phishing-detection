# SafeNet ‚Äì Real-Time Phishing Detection

SafeNet is a real-time phishing detection system that monitors the screen, extracts visible text using OCR (Tesseract), and analyzes it using a DistilBERT-based classifier to detect phishing attempts.  
When suspicious content is found, the system can alert the user or log the case for review.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Event Triggered**: The system detects user activity (e.g., scrolling, typing).
2. **Screenshot**: It captures the current screen.
3. **OCR**: Text is extracted using Tesseract.
4. **Analysis**: The text is chunked and sent to a DistilBERT model for phishing classification.
5. **Decision**: If phishing is detected (above a threshold), it logs or alerts.
6. **Optional backup**: Uncertain cases can be re-analyzed via OpenAI API.
